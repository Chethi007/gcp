# GCP
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) learning materials.

[GCP Learning Wiki](https://github.com/bobbae/gcp/wiki) contains [documents](https://github.com/bobbae/gcp/wiki/GCP-Learning-main-document) and [links](https://github.com/bobbae/gcp/wiki/GCP-Learning-Links) that can be useful in learning about GCP.

[Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) can be used to practice hands-on learning on GCP.

[Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) can be used to learn GCP interactively.

[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) can be used to run [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) containing code to run on GCP.

[AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks) can host jupyter notebooks as well.

[Codelab setting up a AI Platform Notebook](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/prototyping-caip-notebooks/#0) shows how to set up AI Platform notebooks.

[Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs) also can be used to host jupyter notebooks. This is done by installing datalab and serving it on a VM.

[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is a fully managed serverless platform offered in GCP for scalable containerized applications. It uses Knative, Kubernetes and service mesh and works with [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build), [Cloud Code](https://cloud.google.com/code) and [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry).
