# Challenge:  basketball-rain

* First read the `Basic rules for challenges` (https://github.com/bobbae/gcp/blob/main/challenges/README.md). 

* Summary: Given the description, come up with a prediction. 

## Steps

* Consider the following description:
```
Suppose, from 4 basketball matches, John won 3 and Harry won only one.
```

* Question 1:  If you have to bet on either John or Harry for the next match who would you bet on?

* Question 2: What is the percentage of the chance that Harry might win the next match?

* Now, consider further:
```
Now, add another factor to the match, which is rain. 
When Harry won, it was raining. But, when John won, out of 3 matches, 1 
time it was raining.

By the way, the weather forecast says that there is an extremely high possibility of 
rain on the day of the next match which is tomorrow. 
And the forecast is typically very accurate.
```

* Question 3: Do you agree that even without thinking deeply, 
you can tell that the comparison basis has 
changed and chances of Harry winning have increased?

* Question 4: Who would you bet on as the winner of the next match?

* Question 5: What is the percentage of the chance that Harry will win the next 
match given that it will rain tomorrow?

## What to submit

* Answers to questions 1 through 5.

* Reasons for your answers in as much detail as possible.
