# Challenge:  tennis-rain

* First read the `Basic rules for challenges` (https://github.com/bobbae/gcp/blob/main/challenges/README.md). 

* Summary: Given the description, come up with a prediction. This is not necessarily a `coding test`. You do
not have to code anything.  You can simply write down what you think in text.   This is a quick challenge. You
should only spend maybe five minutes thinking about it.

## Steps

* Consider the following description:
```
Suppose, from 4 tennis matches, Bob won 3 and Bill won only one.
```

* Question 1:  If you have to bet on either Bob or Bill for the next match who would you bet on?

* Question 2: What is the percentage of the chance that Bill might win the next match?

* Now, consider further:
```
Now, add another factor to the match, which is rain. 
When Bill won, it was raining. But, when Bob won, out of 3 matches, 1 
time it was raining.

By the way, the weather forecast says that there is an extremely high possibility of 
rain on the day of the next match which is tomorrow. 
And the forecast is typically very accurate.
```

* Question 3: Do you agree that even without thinking deeply, 
you can tell that the comparison basis has 
changed and chances of Bill winning have increased?

* Question 4: Who would you bet on as the winner of the next match?

* Question 5: What is the percentage of the chance that Bill will win the next 
match given that it will rain tomorrow?

## What to prepare for further discussion

* Answers to questions 1 through 5.

* Reasons for your answers in as much detail as possible.

* Be ready to discuss your answers and reasoning.
