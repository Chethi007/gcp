# Basic Rules for the Challenges 

* Your answer will be completely original and not based on someone else's work.

* In general, you should not spend more than a few
hours to complete your answer.  

* We still allow for 5 working days of calendar time so that
you can find a few hours in your schedule.

* Please submit your answer via gitlab or github within 5 days of learning about the challenge.

* Please make your git repository publicly accessible when submitting your answers, and send us the URL.

* You can also use Codepen.io or Jupyter lab or equivalent to implement the solution and send us the publicly available link.

* You can use any one of the following scripting or programming languages: Bash, Python, Node.js, Deno, Ruby, Perl, C, C++, Java, Kotlin, C#, Go, Rust, Scala, Haskell, Ocaml, Smalltalk, Common LISP, clojure, or V.

* The challenges are described in the final and complete form. 

* Whatever may be considered missing in the description of each challenge can be assumed to be intentional.  No further clarification will be provided.

* Your understanding the description of the challenge in the presented form is part of the test.

* Your abililty to come up with a solution for the problem as presented in each challenge description as written is part of the evaluation process. 

* Your choices of programming tools, frameworks, methods and approaches are also part of the evaluation.

* How quickly you respond and submit your solution also may influence the evaluation.

* It is up to you to provide us a clear URL to a git repo
that contains all that you think will be sufficient to let us know that you have provided the complete solutions to the problem which may include
code, documentation, tests, design notes, etc. 

* How you organize your repository, code, data, documentation and all artifacts in your repository will be part of the evaluation.

* Your repository should contain a script called `run.sh` or `run.bat` that will run the
code and produce the results.  That is to say, the reviewer of your work should just be able to run one script to see that it compiles if necessary 
and runs the program and produces the output with all of the necessary arguments and inputs required, without having to read line by line what you have created in your solutions.

* You are encouraged to provide any feedback, criticism, or points for improvements in a written form on these challenges presented to you.

* Your ability to follow the instructions carefully as written here is part of the evaluation.
