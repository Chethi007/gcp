# Basic Rules for the Challenges 


* First, thank you for participating in the challenges!  

* We have tried hard to make sure you will not spend more than a few
hours to complete your answer.  **Please do not spend more than a few hours!**

* We still allow for **48 hours** so that
you can find a few hours in your schedule. **Please return your work to us within 48 hours**.

* **Pick one of the challenges in one of the directories here**. You can do more than one if you wish but we only require that you pick one and submit answers for one. The challenge `tennis-rain` is for discussion only and cannot be chosen as your only challenge. You must choose a coding challenge other than `tennis-rain` to return your answers.

* Your answer will be completely original and not based on someone else's work. We are aware some challenges are available with
solutions from various websites.  If your solution is based on any previous solutions, please clearly indicate the source.

* You can use any one of the following scripting or programming languages:  **Python, Node.js, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust**.  

* Please submit your answer via  a public github repository you have created. **You should submit URL to your public github repo when you return your answers to us.**
Your repository should contain: code, scripts, documentation, tests, design notes, etc. 

* Your git repository should contain a script called `run.sh` or `run.bat` that will run the
code and produce the results.  That is to say, the reviewer of your work should just be able to run one script to see that it compiles if necessary 
and runs the program and produces the output with all of the necessary arguments and inputs required, without having to read line by line what you have created in your solutions.

* Your git repository should contain a `README.md` file which provides information about the code, algorithm, design, and other related facts about your solutions.

* The challenges are described in the final and complete form. 

* Whatever may be considered missing in the description of each challenge can be assumed to be intentional.  **No further clarification will be provided**.

* You are encouraged to provide any corrections, feedback, criticism, or suggestions for improvements in writing.

* **Your ability to follow the instructions carefully as written here is part of the evaluation**.
