Based on [Tutorial by Gary Stafford](https://garystafford.medium.com/big-data-analytics-with-java-and-python-using-cloud-dataproc-googles-fully-managed-spark-and-bf29fff637f2).
The `Makefile` here contains steps to create dataproc cluster, install spark applications, run analytics, etc.
The `config.mk` should be edited to reflect your environment.
